**ðŸš€ Image to Sketch Converter App ðŸŽ¨**

Iâ€™m excited to share a Python project I recently developed: an Image to Sketch Converter! This application uses OpenCV for image processing and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to load an image, convert it into a pencil sketch, and save the sketch with a unique filename to avoid overwriting previous results.

**Key Features:

- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive GUI with buttons to load images and generate sketches.

- Unique Sketch Saving: Each sketch is saved with a timestamp to ensure no overwriting.

- Clear Output: High-quality sketch generation using Gaussian blur and inversion techniques.

**How to Run the Program:
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries using pip:

1- pip install opencv-python pillow
2- pip install python-tk

**Use the App:

- Click Load Image to select an image file.
- Click Convert to Sketch to generate and save the sketch.
